ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @T-Patricia. I'm a passionate beginner developer with a strong commitment to mastering my craft. While I'm at the start of my coding journey, my drive for excellence and attention to detail push me to constantly improve. I believe that even the smallest detail can make a big difference, and Iâ€™m always motivated to find the most effective and elegant solutions.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in expanding my knowledge of frontend development and enhancing user experiences with visually appealing, responsive interfaces. I'm dedicated to self-improvement and currently focusing on JavaScript frameworks and web performance optimization. In my free time, I unwind by playing video games, which helps me sharpen my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to stay focusedâ€”traits I apply to my coding projects as well.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently on a frontend career path on Scrimba, focused on mastering HTML and CSS to solidify my foundation. I'm preparing to dive into JavaScript soon, as the next step in my journey to becoming a well-rounded frontend developer.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a design enthusiast who enjoys merging creativity with technology. In my free time, I love to experiment with DIY projects and crafting, which fuels my imagination and sharpens my eye for detail.
